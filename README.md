# Minesweeper Project
This project features a fully functional classic game of Minesweeper developed in C++ using the SFML library. The game includes a graphical user interface for interactive gameplay and utilizes object-oriented programming principles to manage game objects, recursive methods for game logic, and front-end input handling to adjust the visibility of graphical elements such as mines and flags.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface: Rendered using the SFML library to provide an interactive and visually appealing Minesweeper game.
- Object-Oriented Design: Game objects are represented using classes and objects, promoting modularity and ease of debugging.
- Recursive Methods: Implemented for revealing cells, ensuring efficient and correct game logic.
- Interactive Elements: Input handling to place flags and reveal cells, providing a smooth user experience.

## Run Locally
To compile and run this project, you will need:
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- SFML library for graphics and input handling.
